        <h2>What makes a hero?</h2>
        <p>A hero is someone who cares for those around them as well as those they care for. Someone who is brave, kind, courageous, caring, a person you can rely on and trust.</p>
        <p>These are some of the reasons why I chose Aragorn as someone that inspires me. Even as a fictional character Aragorn represents true qualities that are often considerd both feminine and masculine, such as caregiving, gentleness, courage, bravery, protective, and caring.</p>
        <p>Even when I was younger I could tell that Aragorn was a character that I should inspire to be like, someone people could look up to and count on, but also feel close and safe with even emotionally.</p>
        <p> Many characters are loved within books and media but that doens't always mean the character is someone to look up to, but Aragorn is, is why he someone that inpires me and encourages me to be a better version of myself.</p>
