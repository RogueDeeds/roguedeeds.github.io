	<p>Below I shall share some of my favorite, humorous memes and videos.</p>
	  <h2>Things That I Find Hilarious</h2>
	<h3>First up:</h3>
		  <p>I find many things entertatining and picking just three was a hard decission but I ultimatley landed on ones that I've been laughing about for years or found so entertaining that I genuinely laughed out loud.</p>
		<p><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/696509898647631453/">A Lord of the Rings and Star Wars crossover...? Yes please!</a></p>
		  <p>As a giant Lord of the Rings and Star Wars geek, I obviously gotta love crossover memes such as this one. I have over 7,000 Lord of the Rings memes saved and over 6,000 Star Wars memes so picking just one is hard.</p> 
	<p>Another Solid laugh for number two</p>
		<p><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/448178600399449062/">Just a lil D&d and some Skyrim humor</a></p>
