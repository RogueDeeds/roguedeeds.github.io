    <h1>Amuse (Me)</h1>
	<p>Below I shall share some of my favorite, humorous memes and videos.</p>
	  <h2>Things That I Find Hilarious</h2>
		   <p>I find many things entertaining and picking just three was a hard decision but I ultimately landed on ones that I've been laughing about for years or found so entertaining that I genuinely laughed out loud.</p>
	<h3>First up:</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/696509898647631453/">A Lord of the Rings and Star Wars crossover...? Yes please!</a></p>
		  <p>As a giant Lord of the Rings and Star Wars geek, I obviously gotta love crossover memes such as this one. I have over 7,000 Lord of the Rings memes saved and over 6,000 Star Wars memes so picking just one is hard.</p> 
	<h3>Another Solid laugh for number two</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/448178600399449062/">Just a lil D&d and some Skyrim humor</a></p>
		  <p>This one I found hilarious because while I was looking through my Skyrim and D&D memes I found this one. I love it cause it sounds so cheery and then it's like oop not what I expected. As someone who used necormancy in Skyrim it made me cackle.</p>
	<h3>Third and Final</h3> 
		<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Kn6kSrAD30">An old Vine I never forgot</a></p>
		<p>For my final online amusement I chose this video, it was on Vine back when Vine was still around and was uploaded to YouTube where it now lives. I still come back to this one and still find it hilarious, its a common quote between me and my siblngs to this day.</p>
