               <h3>1. Plant and Grow Milkweed.</h3>
               <li>Common Milkweed (Asclepias syriaca): It native to colorado and thrives in high altitude. Showy Milkweed (Asclepias speciosa) is also native to Colorado Both will thrive in Colorado and create a positive impact for Monarchs.</li>
		<li>Milkweed is essential for the survival of Monarch butterflies. Monarchs will lay 300-500 eggs within a five week period, laying each egg on milkweed. When the eggs hatch and grow into catepillars, the catepillars will eat the milkweed to grow and prepare for the long migration as a butterfly.</li>
		<li>Without milkweed Monarch butterflies don't have a place to lay their eggs and even if they found a different plant to lay her eggs, the baby catepillars still need milkweed to help them grow.</li>
		<li>This is why growing milkweed is an essential part of helping the Monarchs. To grow milkweed, you don't even need a full yard. You can grow milkweed in pots and planters and place them on decks, balconies, and porches.</li>
		<li>If you have a yard, consider planting milkweed along your fence, by your house, or even plant an entire pollinator garden to not only help nurture butterflies but help other important pollinators such as bumble bees, humming birds, and many more.</li>
		<li>You can also plant milkweed in your public gardens, or ask your local businesses and libraries if they'll considered growing milkweed too. With just a couple of people planting milkweed could make an impact, now if we all plant at least one; we could bring forth a positive impact for the Monarch population.</li>
		<li>Diversity of milkweed is also important, providing different types of milkweed is beneficial for all butterflies and Monarchs because it's more inviting to them. It's like seeing a beautiful and assorted neighborhhood where they can have their babies. With more plants to lay their eggs on the more likely a Monarch is going to lay her eggs and the more eggs she'll lay. </li>
		<When planting milkweed it's important to note which milkweed plants are native to yout area. In Colorado Common Milkweed (Asclepias syriaca) and  Showy Milkweed (Asclepias speciosa) are both native to Colorado and are preferred choices to plant. Other milkweed such as Tropical Milkweed (Asclepias curassavica) is not native to Colorado and is in fact dangerous for Monarchs as it encourages them to break their migratory pattern and makes them susceptible to disease.</li>
