		<h1>New Dinosaur Discovery</h1>
		<h2>Closest Relative to the Tyrannosaurus Rex</h2>
		<p>Fossils found in 1983 at Las Cruces, New Mexico were originally believed to be the fossil of the Tyrannosaurus Rex. The fossil found was the jaw bone of a large carnivore specifically a theropod.
		After further examination it was revealed the fossil didn't belong to the famous T-Rex but rather a whole other species of theropod but not only that a species that is the closest relative to the T-Rex yet.
		The new species of dinosaur has been named Tyrannosaurus mcraeensis. The general shape of the jaw of the new species of Tyrannosaurus is similar to the T. rex, but there are two key components in which they are different, Anthony Fiorello, executive director of New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science, told ABC News.
		The jaw of the Tyrannosaurus mcraeensis is much more slender than what you see in the robust lower jaw of the T. rex, which implies a different way of processing food, Fiorello said. The other difference lies in the prominent ridge, postorbital bone, the bone around the eye, which could have something to do with how the species attracted mates, Fiorello said.
		"Those are some pretty key biological differences," he said.
